# ðŸ”¥ Project Forge

This Github repository will serve primarily as the project management hub
for sprint planning, task tracking, etc.  

## Background
Project Forge is a 3 month collaborative technical project for the
NCPI FHIR working group to allow teams to gain hands-on experience with FHIR.

This will allow us to better communicate and create a roadmap for clinical
data interoperability between datasets hosted by participants in NCPI.

## Objectives

- Collaboratively develop, test, and deploy a FHIR model for
  the dataset(s) selected for this project
- Map, transform, and load source data as FHIR resources into the NCPI
  development FHIR server
- Search and review FHIR data using the search API or FHIR Data Dashboard
â€‹
## Goals
- Spark ideas for collaboration on tool development, standards, and processes
- Develop a shared understanding of the current challenges in FHIR
- Start discussions on what interoperable FHIR model(s) look like
- Better inform a longer term FHIR interoperability roadmap

## Project Materials

A space to store working documents and spreadsheets supporting Project Forge
data model discussions and FHIR working group meetings.
